# Generative-Dog-Images-GAN
This project comes from a Kaggle Competiton named <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images">Generative-Dog-Images</a>. 
Data is based on the <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/">Stanford Dogs Dataset</a>. 
<br><br>
## Team
Authors: Gaofeng Huang, Jun Ying, Xi Zhang. Final project of the course Machine Learning II (by Prof. Amir).

## GAN Method
This project applied a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</a>. 
GAN is a the-state-of-art deep learning algorithm proposed by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. 
GAN is a combination of generator network and discriminator network. 
These two networks compete with each other and form a zero-sum game. 
A zero-sum game means if one gets better, another will must be worse. 
As two networks optimize their perfomance when their opponents get better. 
There is a Nash Equilibrium when both generator and discriminator reach to their best performance.

## Objective
This project is going to create a model, which can generate new dog images beyond the training dataset.
